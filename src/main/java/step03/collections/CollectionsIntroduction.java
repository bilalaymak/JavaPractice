    /*
    sort: sorts the elements in a collection
    shuffle: blends the elements in a collection
    reverse: reverses the order of the elements in a collection
    binarySearch: searches for an element in a sorted collection using binary search
    min and max: returns the minimum and maximum elements in a collection
    addAll: adds all the elements from one collection to another
    copy: copies the elements from one collection to another
    fill: sets all elements in a collection to the specified value
    frequency: returns the frequency of a specified element in a collection
    disjoint: returns true if two collections have no common elements
    synchronizedCollection: returns a synchronized wrapper for a collection, which is thread-safe.

         WHEN WE USE TYPES OF COLLECTIONS
         List:
A collection that maintains the order of its elements and allows duplicate elements
Use when you need to maintain the order of elements and allow duplicates
Examples: ArrayList, LinkedList

         Set:
A collection that does not allow duplicate elements and does not maintain the order of its elements
Use when you need to ensure that each element is unique
Examples: HashSet, TreeSet

         Map:
A collection that maps unique keys to values
Use when you need to associate a value with a unique key
Examples: HashMap, TreeMap

         Queue:
A collection that maintains the first-in, first-out (FIFO) order of its elements
Use when you need to process elements in the order they were added
Examples: LinkedList

         Deque:
A double-ended queue that allows elements to be added or removed from both ends
Use when you need to add or remove elements from both ends of the queue
Examples: LinkedList

         Stack:
A collection that maintains the last-in, first-out (LIFO) order of its elements
Use when you need to process elements in the reverse order they were added
Examples: Stack

         TreeSet:
A set that maintains elements in sorted order
Use when you need to maintain elements in sorted order without duplicates
Examples: TreeSet

         PriorityQueue:
A queue that maintains elements in a priority order
Use when you need to process elements in order of priority
Examples: PriorityQueue
