                        (ENCAPSULATION)

      encapsulation is "data hiding"
      to hide a data, we make the access modifier "private"
      after "hiding data", you may need to "read" or "update" the data
      to "read" or "update" the data, we will create some methods
      to "read" "encapsulated data" you should create "get()" methods, we name it "getters"
      to "update" "encapsulated data" you should create "set()" methods, we name it "setters"
