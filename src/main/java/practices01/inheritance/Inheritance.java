        ***  when we start to read code, we should start at main method!!!

          1) we use "inheritance";
            i) to prevent "repetition"
            ii) to make "maintenance" easy
            iii) to make our classes "atomic"
          2) to make a class child of another class we use "extends" keyword
          3) child classes can use class members from the parent classes
             however, parent classes cannot use anything from the child classes
          4) every class in java has at least one parent class which is "Object class"
          5) inheritance Types in java
             i)"multilevel inheritance"
             ii)"Hierarchical Inheritance"
             iii)"multiple inheritance" (java does not support it)
             iiii)opposite of "multiple inheritance" is "single inheritance"
                  java supports "single inheritance"

         //constructors in inheritance
         what is the mean of super() method, it is go to parent class
         1) super() is used to call constructor from parent class
         2) super() is in the first line of every constructor body
         3) super() is invisible as default, if you want you can type it explicitly

         4) super() can be used with parameters like super(true), super("Hybrid"), super(2023)
         5) when a class has multiple constructors to select the constructor we need, we use super() with parameters
