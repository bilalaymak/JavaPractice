      /*
          1) we use "inheritance";
            i) to prevent "repetition"
            ii) to make "maintenance" easy
            iii) to make our classes "atomic"
          2) to make a class child of another class we use "extends" keyword
          3) child classes can use class members from the parent classes
             however, parent classes cannot use anything from the child classes
          4) every class in java has at least one parent class which is "Object class"
          5) inheritance Types in java
             i)"multilevel inheritance"
             ii)"Hierarchical Inheritance"
             iii)"multiple inheritance" (java does not support it)
             iiii)opposite of "multiple inheritance" is "single inheritance"
                  java supports "single inheritance"
