        1) what is th difference between "default" and "protected" access midifier?
           i) "protected" access modifier is wider than "default" modifier
           ii) "default" ones cannot be used from outside the package, therefore its other name is "package private"
               "protected" ones can be used from the class in other packages if the classes are "child classes"
        2)could you please tell the name of the access modifiers from the narrowest to the widest?
           provate < default < protected < public
        3) could you please explain all access modifiers?
