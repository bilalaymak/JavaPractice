    Interface is not a class, but it is an Interface
    A class should be able to use multiple Interfaces as parent
    In an Interface, most methods are abstract,
    but we can still use some concrete methods that are static and default
    we do not need to use abstract keyword for an Interface(for Interface name)
    If we use a variable in an Interface, we need to assign a value (like final variables)
    In abstract class we can have constructors, but in Interface
    we can not have constructors
    Interface can not have concrete methods other than default and static, but abstract class can
    have concrete and abstract methods.
    In Java, when we use final variables, the name of variables should be written in upperCase letters
