  /*
         normally child class must override all "abstract methods" from the parent class
         even if Mammal class did not override anything from the Animal class, no complain

         because "overriding abstract methods from parent" is mandatory just for "concrete classes"

         "overriding abstract methods from parent" is NOT mandatory for abstract classes

         if you want you can override abstract methods from parent Animal to Mammal, it is optional
